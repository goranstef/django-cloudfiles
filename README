django-cloudfiles

Summary
-------

Mosso, the shared hosting provider owned by Rackspace, offers a new file
storage service called CloudFiles. Bundled with CloudFiles is the option to
make your files publicly available over Limelight's CDN. This is very cool!

However, there are some downsides. Currently my biggest gripes are:
 1. no control over headers (namely Expires, which is set at 8 hours)
 2. no gzip
 3. no HTTPS
 4. no hierarchies; you can divide content into "containers", but they're only
    one level deep (a flat hierarchy), which doesn't map well to the typical
    media/{css,js,img,swf} style organization that most devs seems to follow.

This app will try to provide a solution to gripe #4 by:
 * allowing you to keep your existing media structure
 * translating your media structure into unique file names
   (e.g. media/images/logo.png becomes media_images_logo.png or similar)
   and uploading it to CloudFiles via their Python API
 * providing a template tag (or some other facility) for translating your media
   file names into the CloudFiles file names in templates

Maturity
--------

Working proof of concept.

some reporting on how long each file took to upload
